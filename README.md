# rcbup
Robocraft Robot downloader for robots uploaded to Robocraft's Community Robot Factory (CRF)

### ! Currently no support for understanding bot data !
The data can be downloaded (or at least that's what I imagine the data is), but that's all.

# Usage
This is a command line thing. You will need Python3.X installed;

* On Linux: usually preinstalled, use `python3` to invoke
* On Mac: I don't know, I don't have $1k to test it out
* On Windows: Download & install [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you don't have another Python already installed, try `python` or `py` to invoke

To download this project, click `Clone or download` and then `Download ZIP`.
Don't forget to extract the file!

Basic usage is explained with `python3 main.py --help` (replace `python3` as described above).
You will need to be in the directory you downloaded this for it to work.
You can use `cd` to move around, and `dir` or `ls` to see what's around you.
